**How does Search work?**

Microsoft Search indexes all your Microsoft 365 data to make it searchable for users. When a user executes a search, Microsoft Search pulls results from data sources in Microsoft 365, including SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, Yammer, and organizational and directory service information. Microsoft Search uses insights from the Microsoft Graph to show results that are recent and relevant to each user. 

 

Microsoft is also building third party connectors to bring external content into the index. Through third-party connectors, the search experience is enriched to include data and files from outside of Microsoft 365, including Box, SAP, Salesforce, and Service Now.

 

**Microsoft Search for your devices**

For devices using the new Microsoft Edge browser, everything you need to use Microsoft Search is built in. 

 

For devices using Google Chrome, there is a package you deploy that will run a background service. This package is also included in newer versions of the Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise. The background service regularly calls the Microsoft Search backend to see if youâ€™ve enabled the Microsoft Search in Bing setting. Once enabled, the Chrome extension is installed, and Bing is set as the default search engine.
